    "text": "Homicide. Homicide includes five legal crime labels: murder, manslaughter, manslaughter under mitigating circumstances, infanticide, and causing of death in the context of an assault offence. In Finnish penal law, the last mentioned category refers to incidents in which the violence was intentional, while the result of death was not. Together, these crime rubrics correspond to the definition of homicide used in the European Homicide Monitor standard (Granath et al. 2011), capturing lethal and intentional interpersonal violence.\nIn the last ten years, the number of these offences has varied between 116 and 74. In 2021, the homicide rate in Finland was 1.69 per 100 000 population"
