# International comparisons

Making an international comparison of crime rates using administrative statistics is challenging, because legal crime definitions, counting rules and control practices differ cross-nationally. Therefore, criminologists often prefer homicide statistics and crime surveys for the purposes of comparison.

## Homicide.

The Finnish homicide rate has traditionally been higher than is typical in the Nordic area and in the Western Europe. Comparison with the other Nordic countries is particularly relevant due to social and cultural similarities, and it shows Finland having the highest rate of homicide in the Nordic area [@lehti2019]. In the Finnish homicide report of 2019, 73 per cent of the countries representing the European Economic Area had lower homicide mortality rates than Finland [@lehti2020]. The countries above the Finnish mortality were mostly from Eastern Europe.

A recent study comparing the 1990s homicide drop in Finland with six other European countries found that the substantial drop was observed in all countries, and in both male and female victimisation [@suonpää2022] . In Finland, the relative distribution of homicide types remained stable: the most common homicide type was alcohol-related conflict out-side the criminal milieu for men, and family-related homicide for women, whereas homicides taking place in the criminal milieu remained exceptionally rare. The difference was stark with Switzerland, where the typical homicide victim is a woman killed by a family member, and with Sweden, where criminal milieu homicides of young males started to increase in the 2010s.

## Victim surveys

Victim surveys in adult populations. The International Crime Victim Surveys (ICVS) {#abb-FCBS} were started in 1988 and ended in 2005 [@dijk2007] . Due to specific sampling difficulties, the results of the last survey, the so-called EU-ICVS conducted in 2003-5, are not reliable for Finland [@aromaa2006]. The four sweeps from 1988 to 1999, with a core group of seven to 12 European countries participating can be briefly summarised. These surveys suggest that the prevalence of assault or threats was higher than average in Finland. The proportion of countries manifesting lower violence prevalence ranged from 60 to 86 per cent in the four survey waves 1988-1999 [@dijk2007]. Personal theft victimisation yields a different picture. With the exception of the first survey wave in 1988, only few (9-23 per cent) of the participating countries manifested lower theft victimisation percentages than Finland in the 1991-1999 survey waves. Thus, the ICVS appeared to indicate that during the 1990s, Finland was comparatively high on violence and comparative-ly low on theft.

For theft, we lack more recent international adult victim surveys. In contrast, for violence, some surveys have been conducted. Recent Crime, Safety and Victims' Rights survey conducted by the European Fundamental Rights Agency shoes physical violence victimisation rates in 29 European countries. The comparison placed Finland as the second most violent European nation [@f.r.a.2021] after Estonia. Thus, in that survey on physical violence, the proportion of countries ranking lower than Finland was 96 per cent. For Finland, the ICVS sweeps 1988-1999 and the FRA survey of 2021 both indicated a violence problem at a higher level than is typical in Europe, a finding consistent with homicide rates. An earlier FRA survey of violence against women also showed high prevalence rates in Finland and the other Nordic countries [@f.r.a.2014]. Methodological differences in national data collection could have influenced the findings in that survey [@holmberg2022]. Alternative or supplementary hypotheses include: high levels of equality place women more at risk of violence; and/or high levels of education expands the perception of conflicts to be considered as violence, and hence reporting of incidents in surveys will also be higher.

The Finnish Crimes Against Businesses survey of 2018 suggested that the Finnish retail sector suffers from a higher risk of shoplifting and violence against employees than their Dutch and UK counterparts [@saarikkomäki2019] .

## Youth crime surveys

Findings in adult populations cannot necessarily be generalised to youths. The most recent international criminological youth survey is the third sweep of the International Self-Report Delinquency Study (ISRD-3), targeting 13--16-year-olds. Its report shows last year crime prevalence rates for 22 European countries, with measurements in selected big cities between 2012 and 2015 [@enzmann2018] . In that study, Finland's ranking varied according to different types of victimisation. In robbery victimisation, Finland had the highest prevalence in Europe, while in assault victimisation, only 18 % of the comparison countries had lower victimisation prevalence than Finland. Thus, it appears that violent behaviour against youths in Finnish cities was expressed as robberies in 2012-2013. The offenders were typically slightly older youths, with over-representation by persons identified by the victims as being of non-Finnish origin [@kivivuori2014] .

The Health Behaviour in School Aged Children survey (HBSC), operated by the World Health Organization, corroborates the low Finnish assault/violence victimisation prevalence. In 2018, among 15-year-olds, only 12 per cent of the 43 comparison countries manifested a lower prevalence rate of fighting than Finland [@inchley2020].

In ISRD3, Finland also ranked relatively high in theft victimisation, as 86 per cent of the comparison countries had lower last year prevalence. The same applied to hate crime victimisation (73 % of comparison countries with lower rates). Thus, with the exception of assault/violence, the Finnish youth victimisation rates have been above average in European comparison, as revealed by international self-report surveys. Overall, comparative surveys among adults converge to suggest that violence and threats are more prevalent in Finland than could be predicted solely from living standards and the welfare state regime. At least in the 1990s, theft prevalence was below most comparison countries. It is unfortunate that the International Crime Victim Surveys were discontinued after 2005.

In contrast, Finnish youths do not emerge as suffering from heightened violence risk, with the possible exception of robbery. Relatively high violence victimisation rates among adults, as suggested by international crime surveys, could also reflect methodological factors, such as more honest responding in victim surveys, or cultural factors, such as wider violence concepts applied by the respondents [@kivivuori2014] . However, homicide rate comparisons are consistent with survey-based findings on violence, thus validating one another. It appears to be possible to tentatively suggest that in European comparison, Finland's violence problem may also extend to non-lethal and 'everyday' violence among adults, but not among youths.
