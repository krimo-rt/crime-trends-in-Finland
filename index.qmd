-   In Finland, homicide decreased from the early 1990s until recently; the drop may have levelled out or reversed in 2020--22.

-   Finnish homicide remains dominated by marginalised male alcoholics and drinking group conflicts.

-   Assault offences remained stable in 2013--2022, a trend corroborated by victim surveys. Rape offences increased during the decade, also corroborated by victim surveys.

-   The numbers of child sexual abuse offences reported to the police have varied annually but increased in recent years in both crimes reported to the police and victim surveys.

-   Personal and household theft victimisation decreased, while theft offences reported to the police remained stable. The divergence can reflect theft against businesses being more stable than personal victimization.

-   Fraud and identity theft have increased, a trend corroborated by both administrative statistics and the national crime victim survey.

-   The role of alcohol in violent offending decreased, even though the influence of alcohol remains prevalent in violence.

-   In the 15--17 age group, violence, theft and property destruction decreased in the early part of the decade, levelling out after that. In the 18--20 age group the trends of violence, theft and property destruction were similar to the 15--17-year-olds.

-   In Finland, youths under 15 years of age are not criminally culpable. However, their offences are recorded in administrative crime statistics. In this age category, the recorded assault offence rate doubled from 2013 to 2022. While reporting propensity may have increased, available research suggests that the trend may also capture real increase of aggression. Patterns such as use of sharp instruments and offenders taking videos of the crime have increased.

-   International comparisons of violence in European and Nordic adult populations suggest that Finland has above-average problems related to both lethal and other violence. According to EU-wide comparisons, Finland has a high rate of both partner and non-partner violence against women.
